## Hi, I'm Ziyan Shi（时子延） 👋

AI × Neuroscience × Cognitive Interface

I build systems that externalize human thinking.

Currently a direct PhD student in **Neurobiology**  
(Westlake University & Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology joint program)

---

### What I care about
My long-term goal is to explore **brain-computer interfaces and digital consciousness**.

But before direct neural interfaces become practical,  
I’m interested in building their *software precursor*:

> tools that extend memory, decision and collaboration beyond the brain.

---

### Current directions
- Multimodal retrieval & generative models (RAG / MRAG / hallucination reduction)
- Cognitive augmentation systems
- Neural signal processing & OpenBCI experiments
- Human-AI collaborative workflows
- Early stage startup exploration

---

### Selected Projects
- 🧠 MRAG research & benchmarking experiments
- 🧩 Answer-Book mini program (LLM application exploration)
- 🧪 OpenBCI Ultracortex experiments & BrainLLM attempts
- 🤖 Robotics & embedded experiments (Jetson / sensors / real-world perception)

### Writing & Notes
I write about:
- AI paradigm shifts
- Research reality vs hype
- Building instead of paper-producing
- Personal operating system for long-term projects

---

### Collaboration
I enjoy working with:
- builders
- researchers who want real systems
- weird ambitious ideas
